This project contains the source code for the Github+S3 proxy.

The intended use is to proxy object storage onto Git itself. You can read more about this [here](https://kristun.dev/posts/git-as-s3/)

The following routes are implemented

- [PutObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_PutObject.html)
- [GetObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_GetObject.html)
- [HeadObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_HeadObject.html)
- [DeleteObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteObject.html)
- [CopyObject](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CopyObject.html)
- [ListObjectsV2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListObjectsV2.html)
- [CreateBucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_CreateBucket.html)
- [DeleteBucket](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_DeleteBucket.html)
- [ListBuckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/API_ListBuckets.html)

# Getting started

## Run it with Go

```bash
cp .env.example .env
go run ./cmd/cli/
```

### Local Repository Mode

You can run the server against a local git repository without any remote operations:

```bash
# Using command line flag
go run ./cmd/cli/ --local-repo /path/to/your/git/repo

# Or using environment variable
export GHS3_LOCAL_REPO_PATH=/path/to/your/git/repo
go run ./cmd/cli/
```

In local mode:

- The server will open your existing git repository instead of cloning from GitHub
- No remote git operations (push/pull) will be performed
- GitHub token is not required
- All S3 operations work with local git commits only

The environment values require the following:

```bash
# required for remote mode - replace with your own username and token
GITHUB_TOKEN=
GITHUB_OWNER=ktunprasert

# optional
# hosting related
GHS3_PORT=
GHS3_ADDRESS=
# committer's information
# these are the defaults defined in application.go
GIT_USERNAME=GHS3
GIT_EMAIL=bot@ghs3.com

# local repository mode (optional)
# when set, operates on the local git repository without remote operations
GHS3_LOCAL_REPO_PATH=/path/to/your/git/repo
```

The token requires 2 permissions: `repo`, `delete_repo`

## Run it with Docker

```bash
docker build . -t ghs3
docker run --rm -t ghs3 --env "GITHUB_OWNER=ktunprasert" --env "GITHUB_TOKEN=$TOKEN"
```

## Run it with docker-compose

```bash
# configure your compose file with proper environment values
docker-compose up -d
```

## Development

```bash
air
```

Hot reloading with [`air`](https://github.com/air-verse/air) is configured

# FAQ

## How to set up my rclone to read to it?

```conf
[ghs3]
type = s3
provider = Other
endpoint = http://localhost:8080
list_version = 2
```

This was all I needed to start moving files

```bash
rclone mkdir ghs3:/test-repo/
rclone copy hello-world.txt ghs3:/test-repo/
```
